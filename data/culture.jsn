  "level4Improvements": "The results of the evaluation show that your agency has achieved a Level 4 status in culture. This means that within your agency, traffic management has been established as a core and sustainable program priority. Your agency's efforts in traffic management represent a continuous improvement process supported by top-level management and formal partnerships with other agencies. Your agency likely has significant experience with the action plans encompassed by the transition documents between Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. Few agencies, however, have documented the continuing steps that should be taken to maintain and continually improve a Level 4 status. Compiling that information and expanding the guidance is a key desire of the Federal Highway Administration. Your feedback on both the tool and the Level 4 action items is critical to share. Please consider providing information from your agency on the continual improvement process for Level 4 to Jim.hunt@dot.gov.",
