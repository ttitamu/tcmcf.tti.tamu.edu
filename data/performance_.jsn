  "dimensionName": "Performance Measurement",
  "why": "Performance measurement is essential as the means of determining program effectiveness, determining how changes are affecting performance, and guiding decision-making. In addition, operations performance measures demonstrate the extent of transportation problems and can be used to \"make the case\" for operations within an agency and for decision-makers and the traveling public, as well as to demonstrate to them what is being accomplished with public funds on the transportation system.",
  "level1TargetText": "Use of performance measurement processes for traffic management is not undertaken on a regular basis.",
  "level2TargetText": "Agencies employ performance measurement assessment of traffic management strategies primarily to analyze impacts post deployment.",
  "level3TargetText": "Agencies identify desired outcome measures and consistently utilize performance measure analyses to improve strategy deployment and overall operations.",
  "level4TargetText": "Agency traffic management goals and objectives are mapped to performance measures, which are regularly used to manage systems. Documentation of analyses results is distributed internally and externally and is archived for later use.",
  "level4Improvements": "The results of the evaluation show that your agency has achieved a Level 4 status in performance measurement. This means that within your agency, traffic management has been established as a core and sustainable program priority. Your agency's efforts in traffic management represent a continuous improvement process supported by top-level management and formal partnerships with other agencies. Your agency likely has significant experience with the action plans encompassed by the transition documents between Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. Few agencies, however, have documented the continuing steps that should be taken to maintain and continually improve a Level 4 status. Compiling that information and expanding the guidance is a key desire of the Federal Highway Administration. Your feedback on both the tool and the Level 4 action items is critical to share. Please consider providing information from your agency on the continual improvement process for Level 4 to Jim.hunt@dot.gov.",
