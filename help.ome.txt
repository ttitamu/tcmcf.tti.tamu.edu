In the one-minute assessment, each dimension is shown with four levels.  Select the level of maturity that most accurately reflects the current status of your organization.  Within the table, your selected level for each dimension will turn green.  You may only select one level per dimension.  At the bottom of the table, select the “Show Summary” button to view the assessment results.  Hover over each dimension icon in the left-most column to display the dimension definition.  IF you do not choose a level, the tool will assume a level 1 result.
