The score screen shows the results of your assessment, by either the full set of questions or the 1-minute path.  Note that if you chose the 1-minute path, the second column, labeled “Score” will have 0’s for values.  Scores are only computed from the full assessment option.  If you did not choose a level for any dimension on the 1-minute assessment, the tool assumed a level 1 result.  Click on the “Choose Actions” button in any level result square to begin the selection of actions to transform your agency to the next level in each dimension of maturity.
