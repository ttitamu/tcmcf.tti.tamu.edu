In the full assessment, questions are grouped by each dimension.  The dimension definition is at the top of the page to help remind users of the context of the questions.  Select the most appropriate response for each question.  A notes field is provided below each question to allow users to record information specific to each question.  This information is not mandatory and is not saved outside of your browser.  After completing all questions within each dimension, hit “Next”.  At the conclusion of all questions, select the “Show Summary” button to view the assessment results.  You may also hit “Previous” to return to previous dimension questions.
