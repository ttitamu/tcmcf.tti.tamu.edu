            <p>Business processes, in the context of <abbr>TSM&amp;O</abbr>, refers to activities such as planning, programming, agency project development processes, and those organizational aspects that govern various technical or administrative functions such as training, human resource management, contracting and procurement, information technology, or agreements. In many cases, the business process elements go beyond the day-to-day operational activities and require broader institutional support and involvement to address. All of these processes are fundamental to the success of operations and management activities. Without the right procurement processes, partnering commitments, sustainable funding, internal awareness, and support, there could be a limited capacity to be able to implement more complex operations programs and activities. </p>

            <p>Business processes, in the context of <abbr>TSM&amp;O</abbr>, refers to activities such as planning, programming, agency project development processes, and those organizational aspects that govern various technical or administrative functions such as training, human resource management, contracting and procurement, information technology, or agreements. In many cases, the business process elements go beyond the day-to-day operational activities and require broader institutional support and involvement to address. All of these processes are fundamental to the success of operations and management activities. Without the right procurement processes, partnering commitments, sustainable funding, internal awareness, and support, there could be a limited capacity to be able to implement more complex operations programs and activities. </p>

            <h1>Business Processes Guidance - Level <span class="levelnum">4</span></h1>
            
            <h2>Why are Business Processes important?</h2>
            
            <p>Business processes, in the context of <abbr>TSM&amp;O</abbr>, refers to activities such as planning, programming, agency project development processes, and those organizational aspects that govern various technical or administrative functions such as training, human resource management, contracting and procurement, information technology, or agreements. In many cases, the business process elements go beyond the day-to-day operational activities and require broader institutional support and involvement to address. All of these processes are fundamental to the success of operations and management activities. Without the right procurement processes, partnering commitments, sustainable funding, internal awareness, and support, there could be a limited capacity to be able to implement more complex operations programs and activities. </p>
            
            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            
            <p>The results of the evaluation show that your agency has achieved a Level 4 status in business processes.</p>
            
            <p>This means that within your agency, traffic management has been established as a core and sustainable program priority.</p>
            
            <p>Your agency's efforts in traffic management represent a continuous improvement process supported by top-level management and formal partnerships with other agencies. Your agency likely has significant experience with the action plans encompassed by the transition documents between Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. Few agencies, however, have documented the continuing steps that should be taken to maintain and continually improve a Level 4 status.</p>
            
            <p>Compiling that information and expanding the guidance is a key desire of the Federal Highway Administration. Your feedback on both the tool and the Level 4 action items is critical to share.</p>
            
            <p>Please consider providing information from your agency on the continual improvement process for Level 4 to <a href="mailto:Jim.hunt@dot.gov">Jim.hunt@dot.gov</a>.</p>-->
