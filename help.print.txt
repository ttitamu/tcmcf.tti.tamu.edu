This screen provides the user with the ability to print the answers to the questions from the full assessment path through the tool. Within each question, the answer indicated by the user will be highlighted. Any text specific to that question that was recorded in the notes box will be displayed below the question. If a user did not answer a particular response, the tool does not display a highlighted result for that question. Users may also wish to save their answers for use in another program.  Different browsers have different procedures and options that work best.  Please refer to the Userâ€™s Guide for more detail.
