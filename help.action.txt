Based on the levels determined from your assessment, below is a set of actions that could help you advance to the next level of capability for each dimension. Select the actions that are most applicable for your circumstances. You can also pick actions from other levels by changing the levels shown in the dropdown box.  To select an action, drag it from the left (pink) box to the right (green box).  Print a list of your chosen actions specific to a dimension by clicking on “My Selected Actions”.  Print all actions for a particular dimension by clicking on “All Actions All Levels”.  Change dimensions by clicking on a different dimension icon in the left most column.  Within this screen, the selected dimension will have a pink background.  The dimension name is also dynamically presented at the top of your printing icons.
