            <h4>Sub-Dimension Summary</h4>
            
            <p>Actions under this sub-dimension strengthen agency linkage to research into new and emerging areas of traffic management. The emphasis of actions here is on enabling an agency to support and continually improve the state of the art in traffic management by leveraging available research facilities and capabilities.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Actions</h4>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Identify limitations or barriers to full collaboration between research community and agency and establish procedures and timelines for needed improvements.</li>
              <li>Establish formal research partnership with local universities.</li>
              <li>Become involved in pooled-fund studies to leverage limited resources.</li>

            <p>Actions under this sub-dimension help an agency establish a mutually beneficial relationship with the traveling public. Actions identified here strive to move agencies from one-way information dissemination to two-way information sharing with the public using traditional and nontraditional approaches.</p>

            <h1>Collaboration Guidance - Level <span class="levelnum">4</span></h1>
            
            <h2>Why is Collaboration important?</h2>
            
            <p>The development and implementation of <abbr>TSM&amp;O</abbr> requires a collaborative approach. The effectiveness of most strategies is dependent on improving the coordinated performance of each partner.</p>
            
            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            
            <p>The results of the evaluation show that your agency has achieved a Level 4 status in collaboration.</p>
            
            <p>This means that within your agency, traffic management has been established as a core and sustainable program priority. Your agency's efforts in traffic management represent a continuous improvement process supported by top-level management and formal partnerships with other agencies.</p>
            
            <p>Your agency likely has significant experience with the action plans encompassed by the transition documents between Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. Few agencies, however, have documented the continuing steps that should be taken to maintain and continually improve a Level 4 status.</p>
            
            <p>Compiling that information and expanding the guidance is a key desire of the Federal Highway Administration. Your feedback on both the tool and the Level 4 action items is critical to share.</p>
            
            <p>Please consider providing information from your agency on the continual improvement process for Level 4 to <a href="mailto:Jim.hunt@dot.gov">Jim.hunt@dot.gov</a>.</p>-->
